<h3>The Poem</h3>
<p><b>
Written in 1915 in England, "The Road Not Taken" is one of Robert Frost's—and the world's—most well-known poems.
<br> Although commonly interpreted as a celebration of rugged individualism, the poem actually contains multiple different meanings.
<br> The speaker in the poem, faced with a choice between two roads, takes the road "less traveled," a decision which he or she supposes "made all the difference.
<br>" However, Frost creates enough subtle ambiguity in the poem that it's unclear whether the speaker's judgment should be taken at face value, and therefore, whether the poem is about the speaker making a simple but impactful choice, or about how the speaker interprets a choice whose impact is unclear.

<h4>The Meaning in my view:</h4>
<p><b>
you probably read the poem and ask yourself how this poem related to the real life right?well let me show you how.
<br>in the poem we see a random traveller that have to choose between two different roads.
<br>he choose the road that looked less complicated after a long time that he was trying to see as far has he could for the two roads
<br>he was so sad that he could not take them both,thinking what could have been in the other way.
<br>at the end of the poem he say's that he took the road that was less traveled by and thats make all the different which mean that he didn't walk like all the travellers.</b>
<br><div><b>now let me show you how its related to our life:</div></b><p><b>there is a points in our life where we need to choose how to move on.
<br>we wish that we knew what would happen after we will make our choices but in life we cant really knew.we have to choose and take risks somtimes without really knowing what will happened.
<br>even when we decide on one way we always thinking about what if we were chooseing the "other way", do things defferent
<br>for example in realationship when things become hard you can choose to give up and breakup it is the easy way but you can fight and figure out a solution even if it is a more hard way to take.
<br>i think that in our life we got a times where we ask ourselfe's "what if we were doing things in the past changing our decisions"? or "why i didnt choose the other way" and living our past.
<br>i think that living in mindeset like this will make us sad and not living our life. in this moment we need to be whole with our decisions and keep going to the future.
<br>we need to understand that we cant go back,<u> we just go foreward and learn from our mistakes in the past,be better!.</u></b>
